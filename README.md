# CogniCore AI Studio
[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/bitwhirlpool/generated-app-20251002-163403)
CogniCore AI Studio is a sophisticated, multi-modal AI chat interface designed for developers, researchers, and creators. It provides a unified frontend to interact with a wide array of AI models, including those from Cloudflare's AI Gateway and external providers like OpenRouter. The application features a stunning, minimalist dark-themed UI with a three-panel layout for seamless workflow: a session manager, a central chat interface, and a detailed model configuration panel.
Built on Cloudflare's serverless stack, it leverages Durable Objects for persistent, stateful agent-based conversations, ensuring a robust, scalable, and high-performance user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cognicore-ai-studio.git
    cd cognicore-ai-studio
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project for local development. You will need to get your Account ID and create an AI Gateway.
    ```ini
    # .dev.vars
    # Required: Your Cloudflare AI Gateway URL
    # Format: https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/ACCOUNT_ID/GATEWAY_NAME/openai
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai"
    # Required: An API Key with permission to use the AI Gateway
    CF_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY"
    ```
    **Note:** Never commit your `.dev.vars` file or expose your secrets publicly.
## üíª Development
To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:
```sh
bun dev
```
This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port). The frontend will automatically reload on changes, and the worker is available for API requests.
## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This project is designed for seamless deployment to Cloudflare Pages.
1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```
2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script, which builds the application and deploys it to your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bun deploy
    ```
    Wrangler will guide you through the initial deployment process. For subsequent deployments, it will update the existing application.
3.  **Configure Production Secrets:**
    After the first deployment, you must add your environment variables as secrets in the Cloudflare dashboard.
    - Go to your Pages project > Settings > Environment variables.
    - Add `CF_AI_BASE_URL` and `CF_AI_API_KEY` with their production values.
### Deployment on Cloudflare Free Plan
**Important**: If you are deploying on the Cloudflare **free plan**, you may encounter an error related to Durable Objects. The free plan requires a specific migration type for Durable Objects.
To fix this, ensure your `wrangler.jsonc` file uses `new_sqlite_classes` for Durable Object migrations instead of `new_classes`. This template has been pre-configured for you, but it's good practice to verify:
```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
...
"migrations": [
    {
        "tag": "v1",
        "new_sqlite_classes": ["ChatAgent"]
    },
    {
        "tag": "v2",
        "new_sqlite_classes": ["AppController"]
    }
],
...
```
This change ensures compatibility with the storage backend used by the free tier.
Alternatively, deploy directly from your GitHub repository:

## üîç Troubleshooting Deployments
Sometimes after deploying a new version, your changes might not appear immediately. This is usually due to caching. Here are steps to troubleshoot:
### 1. Verify Deployment Status
- Go to your project in the [Cloudflare Pages dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pages).
- Check the latest deployment. It should have a "Success" status.
- Click on the deployment to see its unique URL (e.g., `https://<UNIQUE_ID>.<PROJECT_NAME>.pages.dev`).
- **Always test changes on this unique deployment URL first.** This URL is not cached by the CDN and will always show the latest build. If your changes appear here, the deployment was successful.
### 2. Clear Browser Cache
If the changes are visible on the unique deployment URL but not on your main production URL (e.g., `<PROJECT_NAME>.pages.dev`), the issue is likely your browser's cache.
- **Hard Refresh**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac).
- **Clear Site Data**: Open your browser's developer tools, go to the "Application" tab, select "Storage", and click "Clear site data".
### 3. Purge Cloudflare's Cache
If a hard refresh doesn't work, the old version might be cached on Cloudflare's CDN.
- Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard.
- Select your domain.
- Go to **Caching** > **Configuration**.
- Click **Purge Everything**. This will clear all cached content for your site from Cloudflare's edge network. Please note it may take up to 30 seconds for the purge to complete globally.
By following these steps, you can ensure you are always viewing the latest version of your deployed application.
